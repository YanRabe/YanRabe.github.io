This is still a **work in progress** and only contains project/intership report for now... Though, please note that I do plan on pursuing my career in pulic research after finishing my degree, so this might actually come in handy in a few years.

You have access to each project's `abstract`, to their `repository link` and to a `pdf` file of the report.
