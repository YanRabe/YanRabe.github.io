## CPPiades 2024 üèâ

The [CPPiades 2024](https://www.cppiades2024.fr/) is a yearly event in June in which each _Pr√©pa des INP_ site from all over France gathers in one place to compete during 3 days in a dozen sports, along with nightly parties. This year, we did it in Nancy, which means our site had to organise the whole event.
I was a key member of the organisation team, by managing both the acommodation department and the IT department. I mainly took contact and delt with most hosting sites in the city in order to find a place for each Classe Pr√©paratoire to sleep in. Moreover I made and regularly updated about half of the event's website with the help of another student. My participation also extended to the actual event, as I had to organise a decent amount of matches, help at cleaning, manage the whole acommodation system, manage the cloakroom during the parties, etc. 
This was an amazing experience in which I honed many social skills by actively communicating with the participants, but also because having great relationships with external service providers was mandatory to secure the event's well-being. As well, it eventually challenged my problem sovling skills due to the many unforseen accidents and delays we had faced.

## Photo7 üì∏

As of recently, I candidated to the schools photography association. For now, I have only participated in photographing the Halloween party, and cannot pretend to a greater role in the association as I am not an official member _yet_.

## Vegetarianism üçΩÔ∏èüå±

Due to my personal convictions regarding animal rights along with the known impact of the meat industry on our planet's climate, it has now been 4 years since I went almost fully vegetarian \(except for eggs and cheese\). This is a fundamentally personal journey I imposed solely on myself, with one of my goals being to better my food consumption's quality and lessen my individual impact on the environment.
