Currently studying at ENSEEIHT, I am a student in computer science. I am passionate about new technologies and I am always looking for new challenges. 

Before that, I was shortly an intern at [MFX](https://mfx.loria.fr/) for 6 weeks, under [Sylvain Lefebvre](https://www.antexel.com/sylefeb-research/)'s supervision. My job there was to develop a small but complete Python app that would help the team generate harmonised 3d-printer profiles for their 3D [Slicer](https://icesl.loria.fr/). For that, I taught myself how to use the Textual module to create a pretty UI for the app, but I also had to actually understand how the machines work. Don't hesitate to check my internship report in the [publications page](/yanrabe/publications/)

This internship was necessary to validate my 2 years at La Pr√©pa des INP - Nancy, where I studied science courses in order to prepare my entry in an engineering school.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
