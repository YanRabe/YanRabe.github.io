  author={Cauzid, Hugo and Fernandez, Teresa and Lourde-Rocheblave, Tristan and Rabefaniraka, Yan and Schoirfer, Samuel},
  abstract={The goal of this project was to allow the user to transform an SVG file featuring a 2D cut of a 3D model by joining the split cycles/paths into a single cycle. This is useful for 3D printing, as it allows the user to print the model in a single pass, rather than having to print each cycle separately and then assemble them. This would also allow for improvements regarding thin 3D prints as well as imitating wood carving for example. Finally, the main goal is to avoid superfluous material deposit caused by the printer's head moving from one cycle to another.},

  title={Refonte des profils d'imprimante 3D du logiciel IceSL.},
  author={Rabefaniraka, Yan},
  abstract={The main goal of this internship was to develop a solution that would help the MFX team to easily create harmonised profiles for their 3D printers. My solution was to create a Python app that works as a GUI for the user to input the parameters of their printer and then generate the profile in lua/G-code for the software. This would allow the user to easily create a profile for their printer without having to manually input the parameters in the IceSL software. This would also enable the team to have a standardised structure for their profiles, making it easier to maintain and update them.},
